    <h1>Immigration to Australia</h1>

        <p>Exploring the trend in the origin of immigrants coming to Australia from 1980 to 2022</p>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
        <div class="text-box" style="order: 2;">
            <p>Immigration has significantly shaped Australia’s demographic and economic growth. Post-World War II, the country encouraged large-scale European migration to build its workforce. The end of the White Australia Policy in the 1970s led to a more diverse influx, especially from Asia. Economic opportunities and political stability continue to attract skilled workers, students, and refugees. </p>

            <p>Immigration trends have fluctuated, with slower rates during global crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and growth during periods of labor shortages. <br><br>
            There is an overall upwards trend in immigration, with the numbers steadily increasing from around 150,000 in 1980 to a peak of nearly 600,000 before 2020. A significant drop occurs in 2019, coinciding with the global COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically affected migration flows due to travel restrictions. However, by 2022, the number of immigrants rebounds strongly, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. </p>

        <div id="line_chart" class="chart" style="order: 2;"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
        <div class="text-box" style="order: 2;">
            <p>Asia has been the dominant source of immigrants to Australia, particularly after the 2000s, as seen by the dark green shades representing high immigration levels. Europe, once a major contributor, shows a decline in immigration over the years, while Africa and Oceania maintain moderate but steady trends. North America shows a slight increase in recent decades, and South America remains the least significant contributor, though it has experienced a gradual rise. 
            <br><br>The pandemic's impact is also evident, with immigration levels falling sharply in 2020 across all continents before recovering by 2022.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="chart-container">
        <div class="text-box" style="order: 1;">
            <p>Economic downturns in their own countries, prompted people to seek better opportunities abroad. Australia's strong economy, political stability, and high quality of life were attractive.
            The Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement allowed easy movement for New Zealanders, while strong historical, cultural, and linguistic ties between the UK and Australia facilitated immigration from the UK.
            <br><br> Today, major source countries include India, China, and the Philippines, reflecting Australia’s skill-based immigration system and humanitarian commitments.</p>
